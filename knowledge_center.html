     <p>Income that arises from selling a capital asset is known as capital gains. A capital asset includes any type of property that an assessee holds for any purpose. The capital assets are taxable in the hands of the receiver in the year of transfer of the capital asset. Such tax is known as capital gains tax. <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/capital-gain-tax-in-india-ltcg-stcg' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Capital gains</a> tax is of two types - short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains.</p>
<p>The sale value of the asset is reduced by the cost of acquisition, and the profit from the sale is charged to tax as capital gains.</p>
<p>Given below are a few examples of capital assets -</p>
<ul>
<li>Land</li>
<li>Building</li>
<li>House property</li>
<li>Patents</li>
<li>Trademarks</li>
<li>Vehicles</li>
<li>Leasehold Property</li>
<li>Machinery</li>
<li>Jewellery</li>

 <p>Capital assets are significant pieces of property like investments, stocks, bonds, homes, cars, and art collectibles. Capital assets generally have a useful life of more than one year and are not intended for sale in the due course of a business. For example, a car purchased for the purpose of reselling and not for use will be considered an inventory. However, a car purchased by a individual or a business for the purpose of use in the business is considered a capital asset.</p>
<p>Section 2(14) of the IT Act 1961 defines the capital asset as -</p>
<ul>
<li>Any kind of property held by the assessee, whether related to his/her business or not.</li>
<li>Securities held by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) who have invested in securities as specified by the SEBI Act, 1992.</li>
<li>Any <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/unit-link-insurance-plan-ulip' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Unit Linked Insurance Policy (ULIP)</a> that is not covered under the exemptions on <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/life-insurance-policy-taxability' target='_blank' class='link-p'>clause 10D of section 10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Capital assets do not include the following -</p>
<ul>
<li>Any stock in trade except securities specified in sub-clause (b), raw materials, or consumable stores held for a business profession.</li>
<li>Personal assets held by an individual for his/her use or for the use of dependants. However, assets like jewelry, drawings, paintings, sculptures, artwork, and archaeological collections.</li>

 <p>A long-term capital asset is an asset held for more than 36 months before the date it is transferred. However, an asset is known as a capital asset even when it is held for more than 12 months in the following cases -</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity shares or preference shares that are listed on a recognized Indian stock exchange.</li>
<li>Other securities listed on the Indian Stock Exchange</li>
<li>Units of UTI</li>
<li>Units of an equity-oriented fund</li>
<li>Zero coupon bond</li>

<li>Mutual fund units as specified under section 10(23D), except the equity-oriented fund.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any asset that is held for less than or exactly for 36 months or 12 months is termed a short-term capital asset and is charged to tax at a different rate.</p>

The classification of assets as short-term or long-term is done on the basis of the <a href='https://tax2win.in/tax-tools/period-of-holding-of-asset-calculator' target='_blank' class='link-p'>period of holding</a>. The benefit of <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/cost-inflation-index' target='_blank' class='link-p'>indexation</a> is also available on a long-term capital gain. The indexation benefit increases the asset's acquisition cost, thereby reducing the profit and tax.</p>
<p>Short-term capital gain is the gain that arises from the sale of short-term capital assets. Short-term capital gains are also classified on the basis of their holding period and the type of the asset. If you have a short-term capital gain, you cannot avail yourself of the benefit of indexation. Also, the tax rates on short-term capital gains on equity mutual funds are higher than that on long-term capital gains. You can calculate the indexed cost of acquisition using an <a href='https://tax2win.in/tax-tools/indexed-cost-of-acquisition-or-improvement' target='_blank' class='link-p'>indexed cost calculator</a>.</p>

                 <p>The holding period of the asset defines its taxability. Whether you have to pay tax on a capital gain depends on how long you have held the asset. The tax rates on short-term and long-term capital gains also differ from each other. Therefore, capital assets are classified as short-term and long-term.</p>
<p>The sale of assets held for a period longer than 1 year and fixed assets held for a period longer than 3 years are chargeable to tax as long-term capital gains. The tax rates on long-term capital gains can be 0%, 15%, or 20% of the taxable income.</p>
<p>Short-term capital gains are the gains that arise from the sale of short-term capital assets that are held for a period of less than 1 year or 3 years, depending on the nature of the asset. The tax rates on STCGs are usually higher than that on long-term capital gains.</p>

<p>The computation of <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/capital-gain-tax-in-india-ltcg-stcg' target='_blank' class='link-p'>long-term capital gains</a> is performed as below -</p>
<p>Long-term capital gain = Sale Price - (indexed cost of acquisition + indexed cost of improvement + transfer cost)</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexed cost of acquisition = cost of acquisition x cost of inflation index of the year when the asset was transferred or acquired.</li>
<li>Indexed cost of improvement = cost of improvement x the cost inflation index of the year in which the asset was transferred or the cost inflation index of the year of improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gain thus derived is taxed at the rates applicable based on the tax bracket and the type of asset.</p>

<p><b>Short-term <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/calculate-capital-gains-tax-on-shares' target='_blank' class='link-p'>capital gains on shares</a> are computed as follows -</b></p>
<p>Suppose you bought 100 shares of X Ltd. at Rs.100 each and sold at Rs. 120 after holding for 6 months. Then,</p>
<p>STCG = Sale Price - Purchase price = Rs.120x100 - Rs.100x100 = Rs.2000</p>
<p>The sale price is computed as -<br>Sale value of an asset - (brokerage charges + <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/securities-transaction-tax-stt' target='_blank' class='link-p'>securities transaction tax</a>)</p>
<p><b>Short-term capital gains on assets are computed as follows -</b></p>
<p>STCG = sale value of the asset - (cost of acquisition + expenses incurred while transfer + cost of asset improvement)</p>
<p><a href='https://tax2win.in/tax-tools/indexed-cost-of-acquisition-or-improvement' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Cost of acquisition</a> - For a short-term asset purchased before 1st Feb 2018, it is calculated as follows - </p>
<ul>
<li>The fair market value of assets is calculated by multiplying the number of shares with the highest share price on 31st Jan 2018.</li>
<li>The fair market value is then compared with the actual sale value of the shares, and the lower between the two is selected.</li>
<li>The resultant figure is compared with the actual purchase value, and the higher between the two is chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cost of improvement</b> refers to the expenses incurred on improving the asset. It includes constriction, expansion, or repair of an asset. However, this does not apply in the case of equity shares.</p>

          <p>No, the benefit of indexation is not available on the capital gain arising from transferring of short-term capital assets.</p>
<p>Indexation refers to the process that is used to adjust the purchase price of the asset according to the rate of inflation in the economy. The inflation rate between the year of purchase and the year of sale is taken into account to determine the real gain and impose tax only on the real profit. Indexation reduces the overall purchase price. This leads to a reduction in the amount of profit and, thus, the tax.</p>
<p>Since the holding period of short-term capital gains is less, the price of short-term capital assets is not affected much by the inflation rate prevailing in the economy. Therefore, the benefit of indexation is not available for short-term capital gains.</p>

      <p>Income Declaration Scheme 2016 does not provide specific provisions for the cost of acquisition. However, the basic objective of the Income Declaration Scheme is to allow individuals to disclose their undisclosed income and pay tax on it to avoid any kind of penalty in the future.</p>
<p>The cost of acquisition or any other consideration paid for acquiring the asset is irrelevant to IDS. Therefore, the fair market value of the asset is considered to be its cost of acquisition. The cost of acquisition represents the price that the asset would sell at in an open market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cost of acquisition while declaring an undisclosed asset under the Income Declaration Scheme of 2016 is the fair market value of the asset.</p>

<p>An income tax return (ITR) is a form that taxpayers must file with the Income Tax Department to declare income from all sources. The Income Tax Department then uses this information to calculate tax and define the tax slab into which the taxpayer will fall. Taxpayers can also claim deductions and exemptions on ITR to lower the tax burden.</p>
<p>There are seven different ITR forms, each of which is designed for a different type of taxpayer. The most common ITR forms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ITR 1: For individuals with a total income of up to ₹5 lakhs</li>
<li>ITR 2: For individuals with a total income of more than ₹5 lakhs</li>
<li>ITR 3: For individuals who are engaged in business or profession</li>
<li>ITR 4: For individuals who are salaried employees</li>
<li>ITR 5: For Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs)</li>
<li>ITR 6: For trusts and charitable organizations</li>
<li>ITR 7: For individuals who have income from overseas sources</li>

       <p>The new ITR forms have incorporated a few changes after the introduction of Section 89A. One of the key changes is the <b>disclosure of income on which Section 89A relief was claimed in the previous year. This change is applicable to ITR 2, 3, and 4.</b></p>
<p>Section 89A was introduced to provide relief to taxpayers who had income from retirement benefits accounts maintained in notified countries. Under this section, <b>the income from such accounts is taxed in India in the year in which it is received rather than the year in which it accrues.</b> This helps taxpayers to avail of the foreign tax credit relevant to tax paid outside India on such income.</p>

The employer has to deduct the income tax at source from the employee and passing it on to the government authorities. In other words, Form-16 is a certificate that provides details of the tax deducted at the source and also acts as proof that the TDS has been submitted to the government. Companies calculate the tax payable by the employee on the basis of income and investment declaration he/she makes at the beginning of the year and deduct TDS on the basis of the same. This TDS is then deposited to the government and reflected in Form 16.</p>

  <p>Just like Form 16, <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/all-about-form-16a' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Form 16 A</a> also serves the purpose of a TDS certificate. While Form 16 is used for the TDS deducted on salary income, Form 16A is used for the TDS deducted on income other than salary. It includes the TDS deducted from interest on fixed deposits, rent receipts, and insurance commissions. It is issued by financial institutions and banks on a quarterly basis under section 203 of the I.T. Act. Following are the components of Form 16A -</p>
<ul>
<li>PAN/TAN and Employer's name</li>

    <p>Form 16 can only be issued and downloaded by the deductor of the TDS, i.e., the employer. In other words, the employer can log in to the <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/login-on-traces-tds-website' target='_blank' class='link-p'>TRACES</a> website and get Form 16. If you are an employee, you must approach your employer and request them to download Form 16 and share it with you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are an employer and still unable to find Form 16 on the TRACES website, you should check all the details entered by you, like the <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/tan-registration-on-traces-website' target='_blank' class='link-p'>PAN/TAN</a>, and ensure that your KYC is updated.</p>
<p>If you are still not able to download Form 16, you can also download <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/view-form-26as' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Form 26AS</a> from the TRACES portal. It also consists of the details of TDS deducted and deposited.</p>

<li>Form 16 is issued annually by the employer and should be issued annually by 15th June of the next financial year.</li>
<li>Form 16 should contain details of the tax deducted at source (TDS) from the employee's salary and the employee's name, address, and PAN/TAN.</li>
<li>Form 16 should provide a detailed breakup of the employee's salary, including basic salary, allowances, perquisites, and any other income. It should also include deductions claimed under <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/income-tax-deduction-section-80-c' target='_blank' class='link-p'>section 80C</a>.</li>
<li>Form 16 contains the total tax deducted and deposited by the employer and the details of tax paid by the employee.</li>
<li>Form 16 can be issued in both physical and electronic formats. If issued electronically, it should be digitally signed by the employer.</li>

                                                <p>The Indian Income Tax Law provides for employers to issue <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/form16' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Form 16</a> to employees if their annual income is more than the basic exemption limit and if they fall within the taxable income bracket. In other words, the employer has to issue Form 16 to every employee who earns more than Rs.2,50,000 per year. While it is mandatory to issue Form 16 if any TDS has been deducted, it is upto the employer to issue Form 16 if no TDS has been deducted. Therefore, it can be said that there is no specific income limit required for issuing Form 16 as it is based on the deduction of TDS and not on the income limit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Compute your annual income from salary slips and make adjustments for allowances.</li>
<li>Verify the details of TDS from Form <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/view-form-26as' target='_blank' class='link-p'>26AS</a>.</li>
<li>Compute the <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/house-property' target='_blank' class='link-p'>income from house property</a>.</li>
<li>Compute capital gains. <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/capital-gain-tax-in-india-ltcg-stcg' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Capital gains</a> are exempt up to Rs.1,00,000.</li>
<li>Determine income from bank interest, etc.</li>
<li>Adjust for the deductions and compute the total taxable income.</li>
<li>Pay the remaining tax after deducting the tax paid reflected in 26AS.</li>
<li>On completing the above steps, you can now <a href='https://tax2win.in/efile-income-tax-return' target='_blank' class='link-p'>file your ITR</a> without using Form 16.</li>

      <p>No, Form 16 is not considered valid without the signature of the employer. As per the Income Tax Act, Form 16 can be issued both physically and electronically. In both scenarios, it is important for you to ensure that Form 16 contains a valid signature. If issued physically, Form 16 should be duly signed by the employer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Form 16 is issued electronically, it should be digitally signed by the employer. A duly signed Form 16 ensures that it is not tampered with and establishes its authenticity, and serves as a validation of the employer's acknowledgment of the deductions made.</p>

                                                <p>TDS is a tax in which an amount is deducted on certain payments like salary, rent, commission, professional fees, and interest. The person making the payment has to deduct the tax, and the person receiving the payment is liable to bear the tax. This reduces the possibility of tax evasion as the tax is deducted right at the source of payment. TDS is deducted as per the rates specified in the Income Tax Act. The rates may vary depending on the type of service and products. <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/tds-rate-chart' target='_blank' class='link-p'>Get to know in detail</a> about the prevailing TDS rates.</p>

Although this is only possible if the total annual income of the payee after including the income on which TDS is being deducted is less than the basic exemption limit. In other words, if the total annual income of the payee from all the sources does not fall under the taxable bracket, the payee can request the payer not to deduct TDS.

<p><b>Form 15G:</b> It is applicable to individual or any other person (except a firm and company)</p>

You should claim TDS with your income tax return file, as the TDS credit is being reflected in Form 26AS.

<p>Ex gratia payment is a monetary compensation provided by an employer to the employee or the dependents of the employee (in case of death) or in case of injury or retrenchment. For example, if a company decides to do retrenchment of employees, it has to pay legal compensation to the employees on an ex-gratia basis before laying them off.</p>

         <p>Pension is the portion set aside from an employee's salary, which is paid out periodically, usually on a monthly basis. The Taxpayer can also opt to receive his pension as a lump sum which is called commuted pension. A periodically paid pension is called uncommuted pension. The source of pension income is usually an annuity fund that the employer and the employee create during the service period. The annuity fund invests the contributions and pays out the pension to the employee after retirement.</p>
<p>The taxation of pension income depends on whether it is commuted or uncommuted. An uncommuted pension is taxed as salary income in the hands of the employee. Commuted pension is partially exempt from tax depending on the type of employee. Commuted or uncommuted pension is exempted from tax in case of government employment. In the case of a non-government employee, a pension is partially exempt depending on whether the employee receives the gratuity.</p>

        <p>A family pension is a regular payment made to the spouse or children of a deceased employee. It is different from the pension received by an employee after retirement. Family pension is not taxed as salary income but as income from other sources. The tax treatment of family pensions depends on the amount received.</p>
<p>According to the Income Tax Act, 1961, a family pension received by a family member of a deceased employee is exempt from tax up to Rs. 15,000 or 1/3rd of the family pension received, whichever is less. The remaining amount is taxable as income from other sources and is subject to the normal tax rates applicable to the recipient.</p>

For Government employees, both PF and Gratuity are fully exempt from tax. For non-Government employees, Gratuity is exempt up to a limit of Rs 20 lakh. PF is exempt if received from a recognized PF after completing at least 5 years of continuous service. However, if the employee has not completed 5 years of service, PF is taxable as salary income in the year of receipt. The exemption limit for Gratuity is calculated as the least of the following: 15 days' salary for each completed year of service or part thereof; actual amount received; or Rs 20 lakh. The salary for this purpose includes basic pay and dearness allowance.</p>

<p>For instance, Mr. and Mrs. Choudhary are the co-owner of a house in a 50:50 ratio; if the total rental income of that particular property is 20,000 per month, the couple can split the rental income to ₹10,000 each in their Income Tax Return.</p>

You have to treat the property as if it was rented out for the whole year and use the rent received as the basis for your income calculation. However, you can only include the actual rent you received for the period that the property was let out and not the notional rent you could have received if it was let out for the entire year.

For income tax purposes, individuals who are aged 60 years and above but below 80 years are called senior citizens. This means individuals who have reached the age of 60 or will turn 60 during the relevant financial year are classified as senior citizens. Further, individuals aged 80 years and older are called super senior citizens. This means individuals who have reached the age of 80 or will attain the age of 80 years during the relevant financial year are classified as very senior citizens. The tax slabs for senior citizens and super senior citizens are different than the tax slabs for normal individuals, as the tax exemption limits are higher for senior citizens and super senior citizens.</p>

<li>The senior citizen should be 75 years old or older during the previous year, which would be applicable for the financial year 2022-23 (ended on March 31, 2023).</li>
<li>The senior citizen should have pension income as their only source of income. However, they may also have interest income from the same bank where they receive their pension.</li>
<li>If the very senior citizen fulfills these criteria, then he/she has to submit a declaration to the bank to deduct TDS from their income in the previous financial year, i.e., during FY 2022-23. If the senior citizen has not submitted the declaration during the last financial year, then the senior citizen will be required to file his/her ITR.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is difficult to file TCS and TDS statements without a TAN.</li>
<li>When you want challans for TDS or TCS payment, you need to provide a TAN number.</li>
<li>You also need to quote your TAN number to be able to submit your TDS or TCS certificates. Not having the <a href='https://tax2win.in/guide/know-your-tan' target='_blank' class='link-p'>TAN number</a> can cause difficulty in the documentation process.</li>

It is an illegal practice to obtain a duplicate TAN number. However, if there are different branches or divisions of an entity, they can hold different TAN numbers.

It is mainly opened by businessmen who need to make payments to their creditors using cheques. Current Account does not offer any interest on the deposits and allows customers to deposit and withdraw money at any time without notice. A current Account is also known as a financial account, and it is different from Savings Account, which provides interest. Current Account is suitable for businesses who want to carry out their financial business transactions smoothly.</p>

A foreign national who comes on a visit can open only an NRO account, while a foreign national resident in India can open a resident account as well. So, this will operate just like any other domestic account. However, one needs to be careful on the likely procedure that would be followed for repatriation. Money in the NRE account can be repatriated freely, while in the case of NRO, certain terms might need to be fulfilled. So, although Foreign nationals may be allowed to open a resident account, <b>foreign nationals must also understand the implications and whether they are allowed to freely repatriate from a resident account or whether specific permission is needed for the purpose.</b></p>

<ul>
<li>By receiving payment for services not arising from any business or activity in India while visiting a place outside India</li>
<li>By receiving honorarium, gift, or payment for services rendered from a non-resident who is visiting India</li>
<li>By receiving an honorarium or gift while visiting a place outside of India</li>
<li>By having unspent foreign exchange acquired from an authorized person for travel abroad</li>
<li>By receiving a gift from a relative</li>
</ul>
<p>The account can be held either singly or jointly with another resident individual. The account does not bear any interest, and the balance can be used for any permissible current or capital account transactions.</p>
